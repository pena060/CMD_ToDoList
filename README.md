# CMD_ToDoList
Command Line To-do list using C++. The user can navigate through various options that allow them to view, add, or delete from their to do list. Navigating is done through a menu which player can type 1-4 in order to make their menu selection. The List is currently made of a Vector of string type. when a user adds a new item to the list, it is pushed back to the end of the list. When an item is deleted, the user enters an index from 1-INF (shown when list is viewed) and that has an offset of -1 applied to account for 0 index when it is erased from the vector.

*I am planning on adding a file where the list is permenantly saved and accessed when the program is launched.
